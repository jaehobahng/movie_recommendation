## Installation

First, clone the repository and navigate into the project directory:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movie-recommender.git
$ cd movie-recommender
```

Install the required packages:

## Dataset

To use this recommender system, you need the movie dataset. Download the dataset from [this Kaggle link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset?resource=download) and place it in the following directory:

```bash
/data/kaggle_movies/
```

Ensure that the necessary CSV files (e.g., `movies_metadata.csv`, `ratings.csv`) are properly extracted in this directory before running the recommender system.

## Usage

The primary interface for this package is through the `recommendation` class. Hereâ€™s a quick example:

```python
from movie_recommender import recommendation
import pandas as pd

# Load your data
meta = pd.read_csv('movies_metadata.csv')
ratings = pd.read_csv('ratings.csv')

# Initialize recommender
recommender = recommendation(user=1, number=5, meta=meta, ratings=ratings)

# Get recommendations
similar_movies = recommender.find_similar_movies(movie_id=1, X=recommender.create_X())
print("Similar movies:", similar_movies)
```
